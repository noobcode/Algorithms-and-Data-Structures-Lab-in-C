# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Lab-in-C
Basic programming exercises with increased complexity, done for laboratory sessions of the course **Algorithms and Data Structures** (BSc level), [Department of Computer Science](https://di.unipi.it/en/), [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/).

The main directory comprises a folder for each lecture. 

Each lecture directory is composed by 
- Lecture slides (in Italian);
- README file explaining the proposed exercises, how to compile and test the code; 
- *src/* directory for the source files of the proposed solutions; and 
- a *test/* directory containing the test suits.
